this method only check number only to its square root

Example for 36:

Test \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) (up to \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \)):

-  \( 36 \div 1 = 36 \) → Factors: 1 and 36.
-  \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) → Factors: 2 and 18.
-  \( 36 \div 3 = 12 \) → Factors: 3 and 12.
-  \( 36 \div 4 = 9 \) → Factors: 4 and 9.
-  \( 36 \div 6 = 6 \) → Factors: 6.
